# Bugs and Glitches

These are known bugs and glitches in the original Pokémon Crystal game: code that clearly does not work as intended, or that only works in limited circumstances but has the possibility to fail or crash.

Fixes are written in the `diff` format. If you've used Git before, this should look familiar:

```diff
 this is some code
-delete red - lines
+add green + lines
```

Some fixes are mentioned as breaking compatibility with link battles. This can be avoided by writing more complicated fixes that only apply if the value at `[wLinkMode]` is not `LINK_COLOSSEUM`. That's how Crystal itself fixed two bugs in Gold and Silver regarding the moves [Reflect and Light Screen](#reflect-and-light-screen-can-make-special-defense-wrap-around-above-1024) and [Present](#present-damage-is-incorrect-in-link-battles).

## Perish Song and Spikes can leave a Pokémon with 0 HP and not faint

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IiPWw5fMf8&t=85))

**Fix:** Edit `CheckFaint_PlayerThenEnemy` and `CheckFaint_EnemyThenPlayer` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff

## Thick Club and Light Ball can make (Special) Attack wrap around above 1024

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGqu3d3pdok&t=450))

**Fix:** Edit `SpeciesItemBoost` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm)

```diff
 ; Double the stat
 	sla l
 	rl h
+
+	ld a, HIGH(MAX_STAT_VALUE)
+	cp h
+	jr c, .cap
+	ret nz
+	ld a, LOW(MAX_STAT_VALUE)
+	cp l
+	ret nc
+
+.cap
+	ld hl, MAX_STAT_VALUE
 	ret
```


## Metal Powder can increase damage taken with boosted (Special) Defense

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGqu3d3pdok&t=450))

**Fix:** Edit `DittoMetalPowder` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 	ld a, c
 	srl a
 	add c
 	ld c, a
 	ret nc

 	srl b
 	ld a, b
 	and a
 	jr nz, .done
 	inc b
 .done
 	scf
 	rr c
+
+	ld a, HIGH(MAX_STAT_VALUE)
+	cp b
+	jr c, .cap
+	ret nz
+	ld a, LOW(MAX_STAT_VALUE)
+	cp c
+	ret nc
+
+.cap
+	ld bc, MAX_STAT_VALUE
 	ret
```


## Reflect and Light Screen can make (Special) Defense wrap around above 1024

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

This bug existed for all battles in Gold and Silver, and was only fixed for single-player battles in Crystal to preserve link compatibility.

**Fix:** Edit `TruncateHL_BC` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm)

```diff
 .finish
-	ld a, [wLinkMode]
-	cp LINK_COLOSSEUM
-	jr z, .done
 ; If we go back to the loop point,
 ; it's the same as doing this exact
 ; same check twice.
 	ld a, h
 	or b
 	jr nz, .loop

-.done
 	ld b, l
 	ret
```

(This fix also affects Thick Club, Light Ball, and Metal Powder, as described above, but their specific fixes in the above bugs allow more accurate damage calculations.)


## Glacier Badge may not boost Special Defense depending on the value of Special Attack

As Pryce's dialog ("That BADGE will raise the SPECIAL stats of POKéMON.") implies, Glacier Badge is intended to boost both Special Attack and Special Defense. However, due to BoostStat overwriting `a` when boosting Special Attack, the Special Defense boost will not happen if the unboosted Special Attack stat is either 0-205 or 433-660.

**Fix:** Edit `BadgeStatBoosts.CheckBadge` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 .CheckBadge:
 	ld a, b
 	srl b
+	push af
 	call c, BoostStat
+	pop af
 	inc hl
 	inc hl
 ; Check every other badge.
 	srl b
 	dec c
 	jr nz, .CheckBadge
 ; Check GlacierBadge again for Special Defense.
-; This check is buggy because it assumes that a is set by the "ld a, b" in the above loop,
-; but it can actually be overwritten by the call to BoostStat.
 	srl a
 	call c, BoostStat
 	ret
```


## Moves with a 100% secondary effect chance will not trigger it in 1/256 uses

*Fixing this bug **may** break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHkyO5T5wZU&t=206))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_EffectChance` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
-	; BUG: 1/256 chance to fail even for a 100% effect chance,
-	; since carry is not set if BattleRandom == [hl] == 255
- 	call BattleRandom
+	ld a, [hl]
+	sub 100 percent
+	; If chance was 100%, RNG won't be called (carry not set)
+	; Thus chance will be subtracted from 0, guaranteeing a carry
+	call c, BattleRandom
 	cp [hl]
 	pop hl
 	ret c

 .failed
 	ld a, 1
 	ld [wEffectFailed], a
 	and a
 	ret
```

**Compatibility preservation:** If you wish to keep compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal, you can disable the fix during link battles by also applying the following edit in the same place:

```diff
+	ld a, [wLinkMode]
+	cp LINK_COLOSSEUM
+	scf ; Force RNG to be called
+	jr z, .nofix ; Don't apply fix in link battles, for compatibility
 	ld a, [hl]
 	sub 100 percent
 	; If chance was 100%, RNG won't be called (carry not set)
 	; Thus chance will be subtracted from 0, guaranteeing a carry
+.nofix
 	call c, BattleRandom
```

## Belly Drum sharply boosts Attack even with under 50% HP

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuCLMikWo4Y))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BellyDrum` in [engine/battle/move_effects/belly_drum.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/belly_drum.asm):

```diff
 BattleCommand_BellyDrum:
 ; bellydrum
-; This command is buggy because it raises the user's attack
-; before checking that it has enough HP to use the move.
-; Swap the order of these two blocks to fix.
-	call BattleCommand_AttackUp2
-	ld a, [wAttackMissed]
-	and a
-	jr nz, .failed
-
 	callfar GetHalfMaxHP
 	callfar CheckUserHasEnoughHP
 	jr nc, .failed
+
+	push bc
+	call BattleCommand_AttackUp2
+	pop bc
+	ld a, [wAttackMissed]
+	and a
+	jr nz, .failed
```


## Berserk Gene's confusion lasts for 256 turns or the previous Pokémon's confusion count

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pru3mohq20A))

**Fix:** Edit `HandleBerserkGene` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 HandleBerserkGene:
 	...
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS3
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	push af
 	set SUBSTATUS_CONFUSED, [hl]
+	ldh a, [hBattleTurn]
+	and a
+	ld hl, wEnemyConfuseCount
+	jr z, .set_confuse_count
+	ld hl, wPlayerConfuseCount
+.set_confuse_count
+	call BattleRandom
+	and %11
+	add 2
+	ld [hl], a
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_MOVE_ANIM
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	...
```

This makes the Berserk Gene use the regular confusion duration (2-5 turns).


## Confusion damage is affected by type-boosting items and Explosion/Self-Destruct doubling

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://twitter.com/crystal_rby/status/874626362287562752))

**Fix:**

First, edit [wram.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/wram.asm):

```diff
 wTurnEnded:: db

-	ds 1
+wIsConfusionDamage:: db

 wPlayerStats::
```

Then edit four routines in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 HitSelfInConfusion:
 	...
 	call TruncateHL_BC
 	ld d, 40
 	pop af
 	ld e, a
+	ld a, TRUE
+	ld [wIsConfusionDamage], a
 	ret
```

```diff
 BattleCommand_DamageCalc:
 ; damagecalc
 	...
 .skip_zero_damage_check
+	xor a ; Not confusion damage
+	ld [wIsConfusionDamage], a
+	; fallthrough
+
+ConfusionDamageCalc:
 ; Minimum defense value is 1.
 	ld a, c
 	and a
 	jr nz, .not_dividing_by_zero
 	ld c, 1
 .not_dividing_by_zero

 	...

 ; Item boosts
+
+; Item boosts don't apply to confusion damage
+	ld a, [wIsConfusionDamage]
+	and a
+	jr nz, .DoneItem
+
 	call GetUserItem

 	...
```

```diff
 CheckEnemyTurn:
 	...

 	ld hl, HurtItselfText
 	call StdBattleTextbox

 	call HitSelfInConfusion
-	call BattleCommand_DamageCalc
+	call ConfusionDamageCalc
 	call BattleCommand_LowerSub

 	...
```

```diff
 HitConfusion:
 	ld hl, HurtItselfText
 	call StdBattleTextbox

 	xor a
 	ld [wCriticalHit], a

 	call HitSelfInConfusion
-	call BattleCommand_DamageCalc
+	call ConfusionDamageCalc
 	call BattleCommand_LowerSub
```


## Saves corrupted by mid-save shutoff are not handled

([Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqtK0l6bu0), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2zHd1BPtvc))

**Fix:** Edit `MoveMonWOMail_InsertMon_SaveGame` and `_SaveGameData` in [engine/menus/save.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/menus/save.asm):

```diff
 MoveMonWOMail_InsertMon_SaveGame:
 	...
 	ld a, TRUE
 	ld [wSaveFileExists], a
 	farcall StageRTCTimeForSave
 	farcall BackupMysteryGift
-	call ValidateSave
+	call InvalidateSave
 	call SaveOptions
 	call SavePlayerData
 	call SavePokemonData
 	call SaveChecksum
-	call ValidateBackupSave
+	call ValidateSave
+	call InvalidateBackupSave
 	call SaveBackupOptions
 	call SaveBackupPlayerData
 	call SaveBackupPokemonData
 	call SaveBackupChecksum
+	call ValidateBackupSave
 	farcall BackupPartyMonMail
 	farcall BackupMobileEventIndex
 	farcall SaveRTC
 	...
```

```diff
 _SaveGameData:
 	...
 	ld a, TRUE
 	ld [wSaveFileExists], a
 	farcall StageRTCTimeForSave
 	farcall BackupMysteryGift
-	call ValidateSave
+	call InvalidateSave
 	call SaveOptions
 	call SavePlayerData
 	call SavePokemonData

 	call SaveBackupChecksum
+	call ValidateBackupSave
 	call UpdateStackTop
 	farcall BackupPartyMonMail
 	farcall BackupMobileEventIndex
 	farcall SaveRTC
 	...
```

Then create two new routines, `InvalidateSave` and `InvalidateBackupSave`:

```diff
 ValidateSave:
 	ld a, BANK(sCheckValue1) ; aka BANK(sCheckValue2)
 	call OpenSRAM
 	ld a, SAVE_CHECK_VALUE_1
 	ld [sCheckValue1], a
 	ld a, SAVE_CHECK_VALUE_2
 	ld [sCheckValue2], a
 	jp CloseSRAM

+InvalidateSave:
+	ld a, BANK(sCheckValue1) ; aka BANK(sCheckValue2)
+	call OpenSRAM
+	xor a
+	ld [sCheckValue1], a
+	ld [sCheckValue2], a
+	jp CloseSRAM
```

```diff
 ValidateBackupSave:
 	ld a, BANK(sBackupCheckValue1) ; aka BANK(sBackupCheckValue2)
 	call OpenSRAM
 	ld a, SAVE_CHECK_VALUE_1
 	ld [sBackupCheckValue1], a
 	ld a, SAVE_CHECK_VALUE_2
 	ld [sBackupCheckValue2], a
 	jp CloseSRAM

+InvalidateBackupSave:

+	call OpenSRAM
+	xor a
+	ld [sBackupCheckValue1], a
+	ld [sBackupCheckValue2], a

```


## Moves that lower Defense can do so after breaking a Substitute

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwKPRJLaaI))

This bug affects Acid, Iron Tail, and Rock Smash.

**Fix:** Edit `DefenseDownHit` in [data/moves/effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/data/moves/effects.asm):

```diff

## Counter and Mirror Coat still work if the opponent uses an item

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRYyzKRatFk))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Counter` in [engine/battle/move_effects/counter.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/counter.asm) and `BattleCommand_MirrorCoat` in [engine/battle/move_effects/mirror_coat.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/mirror_coat.asm):

```diff
-	; BUG: Move should fail with all non-damaging battle actions
 	ld hl, wCurDamage
 	ld a, [hli]
 	or [hl]
-	ret z
+	jr z, .failed

Add this to the end of each file:

```diff

+	ld [wEffectFailed], a
+	and a
+	ret
```


## A Disabled but PP Up–enhanced move may not trigger Struggle

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v9x4SgMggs))

**Fix:** Edit `CheckPlayerHasUsableMoves` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 .done
-	; Bug: this will result in a move with PP Up confusing the game.

## A Pokémon that fainted from Pursuit will have its old status condition when revived

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiRvw-Nb2ME))

**Fix:** Edit `PursuitSwitch` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm)

```diff
 	ld a, $f0
 	ld [wCryTracks], a

```


## Lock-On and Mind Reader don't always bypass Fly and Dig

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

This bug affects Attract, Curse, Foresight, Mean Look, Mimic, Nightmare, Spider Web, Transform, and stat-lowering effects of moves like String Shot or Bubble during the semi-invulnerable turn of Fly or Dig.

**Fix:** Edit `CheckHiddenOpponent` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

## Beat Up can desynchronize link battles

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=202-iAsrIa8))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BeatUp` in [engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm):

```diff
 .got_mon

 	ld a, MON_HP
 	call GetBeatupMonLocation

```


## Beat Up works incorrectly with only one Pokémon in the party

*Fixing this bug may break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

This bug prevents the rest of Beat Up's effect from being executed if the player or enemy only has one Pokémon in their party while using it. It prevents Substitute from being raised and King's Rock from working.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_EndLoop` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff
 .only_one_beatup
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS3
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	res SUBSTATUS_IN_LOOP, [hl]
-	call BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText
-	jp EndMoveEffect
+	ret
```

**Cosmetic fix:** This fix does not break compatibility, but it only affects what's shown on the screen for the patched game.

```diff
 .only_one_beatup
 	ld a, BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS3
 	call GetBattleVarAddr
 	res SUBSTATUS_IN_LOOP, [hl]
 	call BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText
+	call BattleCommand_RaiseSub
 	jp EndMoveEffect
```


## Beat Up may fail to raise Substitute

This bug prevents Substitute from being raised if Beat Up was blocked by Protect or Detect.

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_FailureText` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm).

```diff
 	cp EFFECT_MULTI_HIT
 	jr z, .multihit

 .multihit
 	call BattleCommand_RaiseSub
 	jp EndMoveEffect
```


## Beat Up may trigger King's Rock even if it failed

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

This bug is caused because Beat Up never sets `wAttackMissed`, even when no Pokémon was able to attack (due to being fainted or having a status condition).

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText` in [engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/beat_up.asm):

```diff
 BattleCommand_BeatUpFailText:

## Present damage is incorrect in link battles

*Fixing this bug will break compatibility with standard Pokémon Crystal for link battles.*

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJaQoKtrEuw))

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCommand_Present` in [engine/battle/move_effects/present.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/move_effects/present.asm):

## A Transformed Pokémon can use Sketch and learn otherwise unobtainable moves

## AI makes a false assumption about `CheckTypeMatchup`

**Fix:** Edit `BattleCheckTypeMatchup` in [engine/battle/effect_commands.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/effect_commands.asm):

```diff

 CheckTypeMatchup:

## Experience underflow for level 1 Pokémon with Medium-Slow growth rate

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXH8u0plHrE))

This can bring Pokémon straight from level 1 to 100 by gaining just a few experience points.

## BRN/PSN/PAR do not affect catch rate

```diff

## Magikarp in Lake of Rage are shorter, not longer

**Fix:** Edit `LoadEnemyMon.CheckMagikarpArea` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 .CheckMagikarpArea:

## Magikarp length limits have a unit conversion error

**Fix:** Edit `LoadEnemyMon.CheckMagikarpArea` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff

 	jr nc, .GenerateDVs
```

**Better fix:** Rewrite the whole system to use millimeters instead of feet and inches, since they have better precision (1 in = 25.4 mm); and only convert from metric to imperial units for display purposes (or don't, of course).


## Magikarp lengths can be miscalculated

**Fix:** Edit `CalcMagikarpLength.BCLessThanDE` in [engine/events/magikarp.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/magikarp.asm):

```diff

## Battle transitions fail to account for the enemy's level

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eij_1060SMc))

There are three things wrong here:

- `wEnemyMonLevel` isn't initialized yet
- `wBattleMonLevel` gets overwritten after it's initialized by `FindFirstAliveMonAndStartBattle`
- `wBattleMonLevel` isn't initialized until much later when the battle is with a trainer

**Fix:**

First, edit [engine/battle/battle_transition.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/battle_transition.asm):

```diff

Then edit [engine/battle/start_battle.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/start_battle.asm):

```diff

## Move selection menu doesn't handle joypad properly

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjFUo6Jr4po&t=438))

`hInMenu` isn't defined in the menu that handles selecting moves in a battle. Because of this, your cursor is usually rendered unable to keep scrolling when one of the directional keys is being held. It's up for debate whether this behavior was intentional or not, but this value should be defined when in the move selection menu. A value of 1 will allow it to keep scrolling, though it's usually 0 by default.
There exists one way in which this behaviour would be temporarily changed in-game, and that's when the credits sequence is triggered, `hInMenu` will be set but never unset. This can be fixed with the following:

**Fix:** Edit `Credits` in [engine/movie/credits.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/movie/credits.asm):

```diff
 	ldh a, [hVBlank]
 	push af
 	ld a, $5
 	ldh [hVBlank], a
+	ldh a, [hInMenu]
+	push af
 	ld a, $1
 	ldh [hInMenu], a

 	...

 	ldh [hLCDCPointer], a
 	ldh [hBGMapAddress], a
+	pop af
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
 	pop af
 	ldh [hVBlank], a
 	pop af
 	ldh [rSVBK], a
```


If you want to make sure `hInMenu` always has a defined value in the move selection menu, the following code will set it to 1:

**Fix:** Edit `BattleTurn` in [engine/battle/core.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/battle/core.asm):

```diff
 BattleTurn:
+	ldh a, [hInMenu]
+	push af
+	ld a, 1
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
+
 .loop

 	...

 	jp .loop

 .quit
+	pop af
+	ldh [hInMenu], a
 	ret
```


## Two tiles in the `port` tileset are drawn incorrectly

This is a mistake with the left-hand warp carpet corner tiles in [gfx/tilesets/port.png](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/gfx/tilesets/port.png):

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pret/pokecrystal/master/gfx/tilesets/port.png)

**Fix:** Adjust them to match the right-hand corner tiles:

## `LoadMetatiles` wraps around past 128 blocks

This bug prevents you from using blocksets with more than 128 blocks.

**Fix:** Edit `LoadMetatiles` in [home/map.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/home/map.asm):

```diff
 	; Set hl to the address of the current metatile data ([wTilesetBlocksAddress] + (a) tiles).
-	; This is buggy; it wraps around past 128 blocks.
-	; To fix, uncomment the line below.
-	add a ; Comment or delete this line to fix the above bug.

 	adc h
 	ld h, a
```


## Surfing directly across a map connection does not load the new map

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFOWvMNG-zw))

**Fix:**

First, edit `UsedSurfScript` in [engine/events/overworld.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/events/overworld.asm):

```diff
 UsedSurfScript:
 	writetext UsedSurfText ; "used SURF!"
 	waitbutton
 	closetext

 	callasm .empty_fn ; empty function

 	readmem wBuffer2
 	writevar VAR_MOVEMENT

 	special UpdatePlayerSprite
 	special PlayMapMusic
-; step into the water (slow_step DIR, step_end)
 	special SurfStartStep
-	applymovement PLAYER, wMovementBuffer
 	end
```

Then edit `SurfStartStep` in [engine/overworld/player_object.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/overworld/player_object.asm):

```diff
 SurfStartStep:
-	call InitMovementBuffer

## Swimming NPCs aren't limited by their movement radius

This bug is why the Lapras in [maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/UnionCaveB2F.asm), which uses `SPRITEMOVEDATA_SWIM_WANDER`, is not restricted by its `1, 1` movement radius.

**Fix:** Edit `CanObjectMoveInDirection` in [engine/overworld/npc_movement.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/overworld/npc_movement.asm):

```diff
 	ld hl, OBJECT_FLAGS1
 	add hl, bc

-	; jr nz, .noclip_tiles
+	jr nz, .noclip_tiles

## `CheckOwnMon` only checks the first five letters of OT names

([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVTTmReM4nQ))

This bug can allow you to talk to Eusine in Celadon City and encounter Ho-Oh with only traded legendary beasts.

**Fix:** Edit `CheckOwnMon` in [engine/pokemon/search.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/pokemon/search.asm):

```diff
 ; check OT
-; This only checks five characters, which is fine for the Japanese version,
-; but in the English version the player name is 7 characters, so this is wrong.

 	ld hl, wPlayerName

-rept NAME_LENGTH_JAPANESE - 2 ; should be PLAYER_NAME_LENGTH - 2

## Catching a Transformed Pokémon always catches a Ditto

This bug can affect Mew or Pokémon other than Ditto that used Transform via Mirror Move or Sketch.

**Fix:** Edit `PokeBallEffect` in [engine/items/item_effects.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/items/item_effects.asm):

```diff
 	ld hl, wEnemySubStatus5
 	ld a, [hl]
 	push af
 	set SUBSTATUS_TRANSFORMED, [hl]

-; This code is buggy. Any wild Pokémon that has Transformed will be
-; caught as a Ditto, even if it was something else like Mew.
-; To fix, do not set [wTempEnemyMonSpecies] to DITTO.
 	bit SUBSTATUS_TRANSFORMED, a

## Only the first three evolution entries can have Stone compatibility reported correctly

**Workaround:** Edit `PlacePartyMonEvoStoneCompatibility.DetermineCompatibility` in [engine/pokemon/party_menu.asm](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/engine/pokemon/party_menu.asm):

## `ScriptCall` can overflow `wScriptStack` and crash
